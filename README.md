# Starship Telemetry
Data extracted from SpaceX Starship Integrated Flight Test videos

Script uses Tesseract to OCR telemetry data and stores it to a csv
You can tweak how often the data is polled (every n frame(s)), which frames to start and stop on, and how many parallel processes the scrip will use. 

The CSV's have had some manual cleanup of erroneous values

I make no claim to the accuracy of this data.
